# spec-mirror-polar

A git mirror of Polar's [OpenAPI spec](https://polar.sh/docs/openapi/2026-10.openapi.json) and the vendor docs linked from [llms.txt](https://polar.sh/docs/llms.txt). The spec is fetched and committed as a JSON file so the repo serves as a versioned snapshot.

The mirror is updated every 24 hours and is designed to be used as a stable git submodule.

## Usage as a submodule

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/distilled-mirror/spec-mirror-polar.git
```

## Updating specs

From `.meta/`:

```sh
bun install
bun run fetch-specs
```
